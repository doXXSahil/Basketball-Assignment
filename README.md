Basketball game assignment
------------------------------------------------------------
I created a Basketball game as per the directions given by your organization and tried to give some of my inputs.
I created a player which moves on the ground siding WASD input and shoots the basketball using space bar, I gave some drift force to the ball so the ball shifts some times according to the distance between player and the basket to increase the game difficulty.
I use score system to be perfect score which gives player 2 points and normal score which gives the player 1 point.
